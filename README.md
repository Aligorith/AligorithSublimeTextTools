AligorithTools - Sublime Text Plugin
====================================

A random assortment of plugins/tools for improving my workflow in Sublime Text.

There are the following categories of tools:
* **Latex Tools** - Utilities for making it more convenient to work with Latex. Most of these are
  specialist tools for dealing with the particular problems I have in my setup.

* **General Tools** - General text manipulation tools

* **Color Tools** - Tools to make it easier to work with colours


Requirements
------------

These have only been tested with Sublime Text 2. It may be possible to run this with ST3 too,
but I haven't tested them on there yet.
